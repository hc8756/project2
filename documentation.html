    -	Being able to search up gifs using the search bar<br>
    -	Copying the URL of the gif using the copy URL button<br>
    -	Being allowed to favorite specified gifs and look at them later <br>
    -	Being able to look for trending/recent<br>
    -	Tried to implement downloading button, but failed due to web security reasons<br>
    Organizing Content:<br>
    -	Starts with logo and name<br>
    -	Has search bar with search button and next to it are filter options<br>
    -	An area for the gifs that are found based on search<br>
